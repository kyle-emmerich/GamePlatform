This is a game platform intended to run multiplayer games developed by end-users written in Luau. The editor application uses the engine for all UI rendering so that it can run on any platform that the game client can be used on and ensures that the platform's UI system is high quality.

There are currently client applications for the following platforms:
 - Windows (very early)
 - Mac OS X (very early)
 
Planned:
 - iOS
 - Android
 - Xbox

 There will soon be game server applications for Windows and Linux. I haven't yet decided on a basis for the web platform, but I'm leaning towards doing what everyone else does and using TypeScript/Node.js...

This platform also serves as an exploration project for AI-driven coding, so expect some... odd choices. So far, it's proven to be a bit like working with a slightly drunk and overconfident intern. AI seems very useful for generating tedious code like commonly used algorithms and math libraries, but not very good for systems architecture. I suppose that tracks.
